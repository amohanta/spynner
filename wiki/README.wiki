= Introdudiction =

Spynner is a programmatic web browser module for Python. It is based upon the [http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit PyQtWebKit] framework, so it supports Javascript, AJAX, and every other technology that Webkit provides. 

[http://webkit.org/ WebKit] is an open-source web browser layout engine originally derived by Apple Inc. from the Konqueror browser’s KHTML software library for use as the engine of Mac OS X’s Safari web browser and has now been further developed by individuals from the KDE project, Apple Inc., Nokia, Google, Torch Mobile and others.

Using spynner you would able to interact with a web browser from Python with no GUI at all (though a browser window can be opened for debugging purposes). Spynner may be used to implement crawlers or to test websites.

Spynner uses [http://docs.jquery.com Jquery] as Javascript library.

= Install =

  * A release version (recommended):

{{{
$ wget http://spynner.googlecode.com/files/spynner-VERSION.tgz
$ tar xvzf spynner-VERSION.tgz
$ cd spynner-VERSION
$ sudo python setup.py install
}}}

  * The bleeding edge version:

{{{
svn checkout http://spynner.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ spynner
$ cd spynner
$ sudo python setup.py install
}}}

= Usage = 

Spynner uses [http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors Jquery selectors] in the methods where a DOM element must be selected (fill, select, click, choose, check, ...).

{{{
import spynner

browser = spynner.Browser(verbose_level=spynner.DEBUG)
browser.load("http://www.wordreference.com")
browser.select("#esen")
browser.fill("input[name=enit]", "hola")
browser.click("input[name=b]")
html = browser.get_html()
}}}

= Parsing the HTML = 

You can parse the HTML of a webpage with your favorite library ([http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup BeautifulSoup], [http://codespeak.net/lxml/ lxml], ...). As Jquery is already being used as Javascript selector, it may be a good idea to use the [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyquery pyquery], the Python equivalent.
