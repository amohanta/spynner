= TODO =

  * Make it possible to use another Javascript library instead of Jquery. The programmer should then override some methods (click, select, check ...)

  * Implement some mechanism to avoid loading every element in the pages (regexp? callback?)

  * Add API documentation (how? Maybe get re-estructured text from docstring and convert then to Google Wiki format with [http://code.google.com/p/wikir/ wikir]?) 

  * There are two missing Javascripts to handle: javaScriptConfirm and javaScriptPrompt.

  * Support HTTP authentication.

  * User agent must be configurable

  * Better cookie-handling (QTCookies -> Mozilla)
