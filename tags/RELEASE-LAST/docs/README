= Introdudiction =

Spynner is a programmatic web browser module for Python. It is based upon the [http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit PyQtWebKit] framework, so it supports Javascript, AJAX, and every other technology that Webkit provides. 

[http://webkit.org/ WebKit] is an open-source web browser layout engine originally derived by Apple Inc. from the Konqueror browser’s KHTML software library for use as the engine of Mac OS X’s Safari web browser and has now been further developed by individuals from the KDE project, Apple Inc., Nokia, Google, Torch Mobile and others.

Using spynner you would able to simulate being a web browser from Python with no GUI at all (though a browser window can be opened for debugging purposes). Spynner may be used to implement crawlers and test websites.

Spynner uses [http://jquery.com Jquery] as Javascript library.

= Install =

  * A release version (recommended):

{{{
$ wget http://spynner.googlecode.com/files/spynner-VERSION.tgz
$ tar xvzf spynner-VERSION.tgz
$ cd spynner-VERSION
$ sudo python setup.py install
}}}

  * The bleeding edge version:

{{{
$ svn checkout http://spynner.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ spynner
$ cd spynner
$ sudo python setup.py install
}}}

= Usage = 

Spynner uses [http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors Jquery selectors] in that methods where a DOM element must be selected (fill, select, click, choose, check, ...).

{{{
import spynner

browser = spynner.Browser(verbose_level=spynner.DEBUG)
browser.load("http://www.wordreference.com")
browser.select("#esen")
browser.fill("input[name=enit]", "hola")
browser.click("input[name=b]")
html = browser.get_html()
}}}

= Parsing the HTML = 

You can parse the HTML of a webpage with your favorite library ([http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup BeautifulSoup], [http://codespeak.net/lxml/ lxml], ...). As Jquery is already being used as Javascript selector, it may be very comfy to use the [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyquery pyquery], its (not still complete) Python equivalent.
